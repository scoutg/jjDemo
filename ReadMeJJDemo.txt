Welcome to the Jumping in Jrusar Demo!

To move your character, use the arrow keys and use spacebar to jump. "c" will trigger the regular attack. Orym and Imogen having working animations for this attack. "x" is the special attack, but only Dorian has that working at the moment. "v" controls Dorian and Imogen's flying/floating abilities. "b" triggers character dialogue. Once in dialogue click the mouse to progress the conversation.

The game window may be small, but resizing it will cause some graphical errors. Future demos will be resizable.

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please let me know. Thanks for playtesting!
